Hands on implementation of Cisco switch port security using Packet Tracer as part of CCNA preparation, demonstrating sticky MAC learning, unauthorized device detection, and port shutdown behavior

## 🎥 Simulation Demo Video

This short Packet Tracer simulation visually demonstrates:
- Authorized device traffic reaching the router
- Rogue device traffic being blocked at the switch using port security
